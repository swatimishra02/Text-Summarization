# Text-Summarization
Document and text summarization is the process of condensing a text document into a shorter version while retaining its key information and main ideas. It is the process of simplifying relevant information from large documentations and literature, without losing the crucial information of the original text. In this project, several methodologies of patent document summarization is explored, comparing and contrasting various ways of summarizing text. The methodologies covered in this report are:

- A. Extractive summarization
- B.Abstractive summarization
- C. BERT model  (Bi-directional Encoder representation from Transformers)
- D. T5 (Text to Text transfer transformer)
- E. Pegasus model.

Steps Involved in Text Summarization

1. Text cleaning
2. Sentence tokenization
3. Word tokenization
3. Word-frequency table
4. Summarization
5. ROUGE Metrics evaluation


# SCOPE OF EVALUATION

-  Aim: To generate insightful summary from domain specific patent data documents while retaining all necessary Information.

-  Input data formats: .pdf, .doc, raw text
Capturing context from text is not implemented in this project

-  Content Category: Patent Data

-  Evaluation Metrics: ROUGE Scores
`rouge 1, rouge 2, rouge N and rougeL`

-  Summarization Criteria: The system will be evaluated based on its ability to capture key information, maintain coherence, and provide a concise and informative summary.
